## 💡 Inspiration

This project was built as a fast prototype under mentorship guidance, to support a larger research proposal on **AI-Driven Genomic Surveillance of Drug-Resistant Pathogens in Africa**.

It draws inspiration from:
- Prof. Tulio de Oliveira's genomic work at CERI
- WHO’s GLASS AMR surveillance strategy
- Real-world gaps in cross-border bioinformatics capability in Africa

---

## 🧪 Future Plans

- Integration with real genomic datasets (GISAID/SRA)
- Streamlit-based live dashboard deployment
- Expansion to more African regions
